# Advent of Code 2020

These are my personal solutions to the problems presented in the [adventofcode.com](Advent of Code) 2020 challenge.
Overall, I'm trying to solve problems quickly, then possibly refine my solutions using more idiomatic Rust code (e.g. using the type system to be more expressive and safe).
Sometimes, I'll skip straight to making "cleaner" solutions at the cost of taking a bit longer to solve the problems.
